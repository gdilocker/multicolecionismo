      - "devops-lead"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore(deps)"
      include: "scope"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check for existing vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
npm outdated

# Verify Dependabot PRs
# GitHub → Pull Requests → Filter by "dependabot"
```

-- Query CSP violations (last 7 days)
SELECT
  details->>'violatedDirective' as directive,
  details->>'blockedUri' as blocked_uri,
  details->>'documentUri' as document,
  COUNT(*) as occurrences,
  MAX(created_at) as last_occurrence
FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'CSP_VIOLATION'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY directive, blocked_uri, document
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**
- <10 unique violations
- All violations are known/safe (e.g., browser extensions)
- No violations from core application features

**Phase 2: Enforcement (Nov 15)**

If monitoring shows <10 violations and all are safe:

1. Update `_headers` file:
```
# Before (Report-Only)
/*
  Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self'; ...

# After (Enforce)
/*
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.paypal.com https://challenges.cloudflare.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://api.paypal.com https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com; frame-src https://www.paypal.com https://challenges.cloudflare.com; report-uri https://[project-id].supabase.co/functions/v1/csp-report
```

2. Deploy and monitor for 24 hours
3. Rollback if legitimate features break

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
# If issues occur, revert to Report-Only
git revert [commit-hash]
git push origin main

# Fix CSP policy
# Re-test in staging
# Re-deploy
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] 7 days of CSP reports reviewed
- [ ] <10 unique violations confirmed
- [ ] All violations categorized (safe/unsafe)
- [ ] CSP switched to enforce mode
- [ ] 24-hour post-enforcement monitoring
- [ ] No customer complaints
